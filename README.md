# ✨ How to use it?
Very easy to use, select the characters you want in your password from the top, remove or add them.
If you want an 8-character password, click on the button with the number 8 on it, the same goes for the other buttons
click on the generated password and it will copy it to the clipboard for you.
I hope it was useful to you
